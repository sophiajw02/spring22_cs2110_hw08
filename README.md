assignment for CS 2110 @ GT Spring 2022


## Game Information
In this game, you will be playing as a black mage on defense. Defend by casting the **Fire** spell! Your goal is to successfully defend against 10 cactuars before they can get past you. 

Be careful if they reach you! You'll lose a life for each cactuar that makes it to your side. You will start each game with 3 lives. Fail to defense 3 times and it'll be game over.

However, choose carefully when to cast **Fire**! **Fire** cannot be cast again until your previously casted **Fire** spell has finished!
